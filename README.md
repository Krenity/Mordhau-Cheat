**To run, please go to the folder you are launching the game from, eg Epic games, and run the exe, that's all. Make sure your game is open first, there is an error message if the game is open however there are no checks if you launched an incorrect version, so make sure if you're on Steam you launch the Steam version of the cheat and vice versa**


<h2> This is a Mordhau cheat, it has been posted on <a href="https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-fps-games/612663-mordhau-cheat-patch-28-a.html"> Unknowncheats <a> </h2>

The cheat does have previously accepted/reviewed downloads, (view below) however it has gotten more and more annoying to wait for approval for a simple offset change, you can view any changes to the cheat by <a href="https://github.com/Krenity/Mordhau-Cheat/commits/main/">Commit logs,</a> if you are unsure if it's safe. On the other hand, the cheat does use a memory injector plugin to make programming a lot simpler<a href="https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll"> Memory.dll </a>
