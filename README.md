**To run, please go to the folder you are launching the game from, eg Epic games, and run the exe, that's all. Make sure your game is open first, there is an error message if the game is not open however there are no checks if you launched an incorrect version, so make sure if you're on Steam you launch the Steam version of the cheat and vice versa**

The cheat uses a memory injector plugin to make programming a lot simpler<a href="https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll"> Memory.dll. Moreover, this cheat wouldnt exist without [UEDumper](https://github.com/Spuckwaffel/UEDumper), the dumper used to get all pointers and data. </a>
